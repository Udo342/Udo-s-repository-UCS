<h1>The Poetry of Late Uba John Ofei</h1>
<h2>No More Waiting</h2>
<main>
    <p> 
        How many times shall we cowardly look the other way in the face of the obscenity of those whose abode is under the bridge? 
        How long shall our eyes feed on the frightful sight 
        of those who must feed from the dust-bins
        in fierce competition with dogs and pigs?
        hHw can we fail to be shaken
        like the tree in the grip of the harmattan wind
        by the repulsive sight of our mothers,
                                  our sisters,
                                  our mothers - 
        selling their flesh to see tomorrow?
        How long shall we pretend not to hear?
                                  not to know?
                                  not to see?
        How long shall we do charity 
        instead of embracing justice?
        Instead of donning the garb of aide?
        We shall see the cloak of empowerment.
        How long shall we sit with inequality
        and inequality?
        When shall we see them
        and name them by name?
        How long shall we use God's name in vain
        by praying for the hungry
        while on the sweat of the famished, we prey?
        How long shall we pray for peace?
        for a peaceful people robbed?
        for peace by guns and goons?
        How
        long
        ? 
    </p>
